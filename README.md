# Work-Day-Scheduler

This is an app that represents a daily calendar for scheduling events.  Each row represents a time from 9 AM - 5 PM where the user can save tasks for that hour.  Each hour is color-coded based on if the time has already passed, it is the current hour, or if it is in the future.  When the user saves the event, it is saved in local storage and the calendar is populated upon refresh.
